=head1 NAME

Net::OBEX::Response::Generic - interpret OBEX protocol generic response packets

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Net::OBEX::Response::Generic;

    my $res = Net::OBEX::Response::Generic->new;

    # read 3 bytes of the packet from the socket there somewhere
    # now parse it:
    my $response_ref = $res->parse_info( $data_from_the_socket );

    if ( $response_ref->{headers_length} ) {
        # ok, looks like we got some headers in this packet
        # read $response_ref->{headers_length} bytes from the socket
        # here and parse the headers.
    }

    # OMG SO COMPLICATED!!
    # Why not use Net::OBEX::Response parse_sock() method instead?

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WARNING!!! this module is still in early alpha stage. It is recommended
that you use it only for testing.>

This module is used internally by L<Net::OBEX::Response> and that's what
you probably should be using.
The module provides means to interpret raw OBEX protocol responses. For
parsing C<Connect> responses see L<Net::OBEX::Response::Connect>

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

    my $res = Net::OBEX::Response::Generic->new;

Takes no arguments, returns a freshly baked Net::OBEX::Response::Generic
object ready to be used and abused.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 parse_info

    $res->packet( $data_from_wire );
    my $generic_response = $res->parse_info;

    # or

    my $generic_response = $res->parse_info( $data_from_wire );

Takes one optional argument which
is the raw data from the wire representing the packet. If called without
arguments will use the data which you set via C<packet()> method (see below)
Returns a hashref with the following keys/values:

Sample return (descriptions are below):

    $VAR1 = {
        'packet_length' => 3,
        'response_code' => 200,
        'headers_length' => 0,
        'response_code_meaning' => 'OK, Success'
    };

=head3 packet_length

    { 'packet_length' => 3 }

The C<packet_length> key will contain the length of the packet in bytes.

=head3 headers_length

    { 'headers_length' => 24 }

The C<headers_length> key will contain the length of packet's headers in
bytes. You would use this value to finish reading the entire packet from
the socket, however, see the C<parse_sock()> method described below.

=head3 response_code

    { 'response_code' => 200 }

The C<response_code> key will contain a response code, this will pretty
much be HTTP response codes since that what OBEX prefers to use.

=head3 response_code_meaning

    { 'response_code_meaning' => 'OK, Success' }

The C<response_code_meaning> key will contain a human parseable explanation
of C<response_code>.

=head2 code_meaning

    my ( $http_code, $meaning ) = $res->code_meaning( "\xA0" );

Takes one argument which is the byte representing the response code.
Returns a list of two elements, the first one is the HTTP code of the
response (such as C<404>) the second element is the human parseable meaning
of the code (such as C<Not Found>).

=head2 packet

    my $old_packet = $res->packet;

    $res->packet( $new_data_from_the_wire );

Returns a currently set data of the packet. When called with an optional
argument will set the current data to parse to whatever you specify in
the argument.

=head2 info

    my $info_ref = $res->info;

Must be called after a call to C<parse_info()>. Takes no arguments, returns
a hashref which is the same as the return value of the last call to
C<parse_info()> method. See the description of C<parse_info()> method
above for more information.

=head2 headers_length

    my $length_of_packet_headers = $res->headers_length;

Must be called after a call to C<parse_info()>. Takes no arguments,
returns the length of packet headers in bytes (this is what you still need
to read from the socket to get a complete packet). Note: this is the same
as the contents of C<headers_length> key of the C<parse_info()> return.
